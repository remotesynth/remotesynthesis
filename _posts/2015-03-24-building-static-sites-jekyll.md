As I've [posted about recently](http://remotesynthesis.com/general/2015/03/04/comparing-static-site-engines/), I've been speaking a lot about comparing static site engines. There are a *ton* of options out there (389 as of today, according to [this site](https://staticsitegenerators.net/)). However, based on my personal experience, I always recommend [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) - granted, that's based on having used 5 of the 389 so far.

I already have a [GitHub project](https://github.com/remotesynth/Static-Site-Samples) where I have built the same project multiple times with different engines as a means of comparison. The readme will guide you with installing and running each of these should you choose.

Now, if you wanted to learn how to use Jekyll using this sample, I have written a [detailed guide to getting started with Jekyll](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/getting-started-with-jekyll/) for the Telerik Developer Network. It walks through the most common things you need to know about Liquid templating as well as how to create and build your Jekyll site.

I hope you enjoy it!

P.S. One common questions I get whenever I recommend Jekyll is from people who don't know Ruby and would prefer a solution written in JavaScript/Node.js and, preferably, available via npm. The [GitHub project](https://github.com/remotesynth/Static-Site-Samples) includes two, Harp and Wintersmith. I have a follow up article that should be published any day now that walks through the same steps laid out in the Jekyll tutorial, but for Wintersmith. I'll post about that as soon as it is out.
