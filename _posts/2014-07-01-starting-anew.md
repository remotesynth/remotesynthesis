Almost 10 years ago, on January 1, 2005, I started a blog called Remote Synthesis. The name came from synonyms for "Cold" and "Fusion" as ColdFusion development was my primary focus back then. A lot has happened in 10 years.

The blog gained a good deal of popularity during the years that I was working on my popular ColdFusion code generator and posting the ColdFusion Open Source List. It remained somewhat popular during my years working with Flex and running the Flex Camp Boston conference (later RIA Unleashed and now Web Unleashed). Eventually, when joining Adobe, my focus started to drift from that blog to publishing elsewhere - on the Adobe Developer Connection that I was helping to run and other writing responsibilities.

In 2013, I started a site called [Flippin' Awesome](http://flippinawesome.org) (now part of The Modern Web). While it included the contributions of many authors, including myself, it took most of my free time and effort to keep it going. It became very popular (and still is). I kept trying to blog, but found my focus and interest waning. Compounding this was the fact that my blog ran on a severely outdated version of ColdFusion and old CF-based blogging software and that it looked hideous on mobile.

While nearly 10 years of content has some value, most of the content was outdated and I had no intention of fixing this. Thus, I decided it was time for a fresh start...which is what you are looking at. I don't plan to blog frequently, but occassionally. I know my audience will be limited, but...so what?! My audience back in 2005 was 1 - just me.
