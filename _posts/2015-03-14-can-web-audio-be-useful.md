Next month, I will be presenting at the [Fluent Conference](http://fluentconf.com) in San Francisco on the topic of "Practical Web Audio." The idea here is that most every demo or presentation about web audio (including my own) have been fun and cool but not practical unless you build games or music software.

So, are there useful purposes for web audio in a standard web app? I wrote an article called [Adding Audio to Web Apps](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/adding-audio-to-web-apps/) that begins to explore some ideas. In almost every case, the demo uses very brief portions of audio to try to add context to some form of input. Notifications seemed obvious - but, admittedly, others are harder to make a strong case for except in very specific circumstances. These were just some of my initial ideas - I have a few others and some variations to the ones I showed already that I am working on.

Have you used web audio in your web app for something useful? If so, please share (and maybe I can even show it at Fluent).
