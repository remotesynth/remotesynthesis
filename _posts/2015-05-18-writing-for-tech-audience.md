I've been writing articles and blog posts about web development and technology for a long time. The original version of this blog started in 2004, but by that time I'd already written a couple articles for the ultra-prestigious ColdFusion Developer's Journal (it's ok to feel jealous).

However, I've also been editing articles and blog posts about web development and technology for a while too. It started when I was at Adobe helping to run the Adobe Developer Connection a few years ago and continued when I launched my own site (Flippin' Awesome which is now Modern Web and not run by me anymore). I still do this on an almost daily basis running the [Telerik Developer Network](developer.telerik.com).

All of this experience has taught me some things that I think help to make a really good (and potentially really popular) article or blog post for a developer or technology audience. In this post I'll share my recommendations, though I should note that I'm not an expert at always following my own guidelines all the time.<!--more-->

##Have a Style

It's important to keep in mind that you aren't writing API docs. API docs are generally dry, boring and simply stick to the facts. That's their goal. However, an article or blog post should allow some of your personality to shine through. This helps to make the content both more relatable and more enjoyable to read.

Keep in mind that your goal is both to educate and to entertain, to some degree. Some developers revert to a litany of code and explanation. It's better to have a voice and have a story.

Some things that can help:

* Explain *why* you are trying to do something, not just what you are trying to do and how you are doing it.
* What made you get interested in doing this?
* Did you have a struggles along the way? There's no shame in admitting that you found something difficult - your readers will likely relate to the experience.
* Have fun with the demo! Perhaps pick something you are interested in that isn't technical. For example. I often choose to use some cartoons I enjoy as subject matter for my demos.

##Know Your Audience

While you should have a voice and a style, it's important to know when it's ok to be more or less casual in your voice. If I am writing something for my blog, I am often much more casual than if I am writing for the Telerik Developer Network or Sitepoint.

If I am writing for my blog, proper grammar, punctuation and spelling are less important. If I am writing for a professional site, these become the difference between seeming like an amateur and not. You'd be surprised how people are affected by these things, even if they do not recognize it themselves. Some sites have editors who help with this, but others don't - so don't rely on them to correct your mistakes.

Try to always have a friend you trust read through the article first - this isn't critical for a personal blog post but even those can benefit. Even the best writers need a second opinion and there is nothing than can make your content better than a good, critical opinion.

##Stay on Track

So many developers tend to think that every little detail is pertinent. So, they get sidetracked. Instead of traveling straight down a path, they don't just point out the detours, but take you down them.

As a rule, if the information doesn't apply to *most* situations, don't spend time on it. These are the kind of scenarios like, if you are running an old version of X operating system and want to perform special action Y, you'll need to do this a different way - let's walk through it. Another example is getting lost in caveats, detailing every minor exception that in all likelihood doesn't apply to the reader.

The best strategy in these cases is to simply point to the "detour" as an aside and link to the best resource to follow. Or note that there are exceptions but don't go detailed into the full list of caveats.

You may feel as though you are being somehow incomplete in your coverage, but you are less likely to lose the 90% of the readers to whom the straightforward path applies by not catering your post to the 10%.

##Avoid the Wall of Text

There is nothing harder to read than a post that has no headers and is filled with overly long paragraphs. Adding section headers and even subheaders for long sections not only makes your article easier to read, but also makes it easier to scan - which can help the reader determine it's value to them.

Shorter paragraphs also make your content more readable and scannable. Plus, a wall of unbroken text can seem intimidating to a reader. Break up large paragraphs and, whenever possible, place key ideas into lists, which I've found can help drive home key points and improve retention.
