As part of researching for restarting this blog as well as for my work developing the [Telerik Developer Network](http://developer.telerik.com), I researched several of the most well-known static site engines.<!--more--> Specifically, I tried to build this site using Jekyll (which is what I ended up using), Harp and Roots. These were the three engines listed prominently on the [StaticApps.org](http://staticapps.org) resource site. I really think that many sites, especially those focused purely on content, can potentially move away from dynamic, CMS-driven site architectures that can be a burden to maintain, to purely static HTML with a "back-end" that generates the site locally.

I wrote up my experiences and review of each for the Telerik Developer Network in an article entitled ["Static Site Engines Battle Royale"](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/comparing-static-site-engines/). If you are interested in static engines, are considering a move or are just curious what the whole thing is about, [check it out](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/comparing-static-site-engines/).
