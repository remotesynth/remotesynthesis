On February 18, I had the pleasure of gaving a [talk](http://www.meetup.com/sfhtml5/events/219180801/) to the San Francisco HTML5 User Group. The topic was static site engines, covering the basics of what they are and what they are good for (or what they are not good for). The latter half of the session focused on comparing three popular static site engines: [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) and [Harp](http://harpjs.com/).

You can view the presentation below (I am also giving an updated version of this presentation at [DevNexus](https://www.devnexus.com/s/index) in Atlanta later this month).

##Sample Application

In order to compare the engines, I created a simple sample site, using data from the [Adventure Time Wiki](http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Adventure_Time_with_Finn_and_Jake_Wiki). The site is intentionally simple, but uses things like custom post attributes, custom global attributes, data and, of course, posts.

You can get the samples as well as the slide deck [on GitHub](https://github.com/remotesynth/Static-Site-Samples). I am hoping to add additional samples in the coming weeks.
