On Saturday, May 2, the first ever [JekyllConf](http://jekyllconf.com) was held online and featured some really prominent speakers including Tom Preston-Werner and Brandon Mathis. I had the honor of opening the event with my session comparing Jekyll to other popular static site engine options including [Harp](http://harpjs.com), [Hexo](http://hexo.io/), [Wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io/), [Hugo](http://wintersmith.io/) and [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/).

In summary (and in my personal opinion of course), Jekyll is still in the strongest position of all the engines. It has the strongest community (partly evidenced by JekyllConf itself), the best documentation (not saying it couldn't be better, but it's better than the alternatives) and has the largest selection of pre-built templates and plugins.

However, it has failed to reach much beyond hardcore developers. This is partly because of the nature of the tool - for instance, few people outside of the developer community enjoy working on the command line...in fact, most find it intimidating. Tooling for authors is weak too - Markdown is a terrible option for authors (who aren't developers). We think of it as being so simple and easy, but that's actually what makes it so complex. In terms of authoring, it covers a majority of use cases, but it is still very common to encounter requirements that it doesn't meet (intentionally, since it's goal was simplicity). Thus, when you teach an author Markdown, you need to teach them the syntax, what it doesn't cover and  HTML to handle those scenarios it doesn't cover. This is actually more complicated than simply teaching them HTML.

In my opinion, until the tooling is available to allow authors and contributors to write using the tooling they love, static site engines will remain a niche solution. This is a shame as they actually seem like the optimal solution for content focused sites and, perhaps more so, documentation sites. The good news is that there are people working on the tools needed to bridge this gap...we'll see how this goes!
