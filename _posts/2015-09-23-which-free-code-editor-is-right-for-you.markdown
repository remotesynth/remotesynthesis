We live in a day and age as web developers where our biggest complaint seems to be a overabundance of free tools. In the case of code editors, there are a few prominent free ones: [Atom](http://atom.io), [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) and, most recently, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Each editor has its own set of strengths and weaknesses. Each is backed by a large corporation - GitHub for Atom, Adobe for Brackets and Microsoft for Visual Studio Code - so obviously they will be geared towards the target audience of each respective company.

Nonetheless, they are all good editors. So which one should you choose?

Well, [it depends](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/battle-of-the-free-code-editors/). You knew I was going to say that!

In my latest article, [Battle of the Free Code Editors](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/battle-of-the-free-code-editors/), I go into the distinguishing features of each editor and what type of developer it is best suited for.

Please, [check out the article](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/battle-of-the-free-code-editors/) and feel free to share your thoughts.

###A Note on Sublime

I was asked numerous times after writing this article, why did I not include [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/)? After all, Sublime is, for all intents and purposes, the market leader for lightweight code editors. The article compared _free_ editors. However, _Sublime is not free!_

Yes, you can try it for free and, as many responses noted, use it forever without paying if you are willing to live with dismissing the prompt to buy regularly. One person even noted to me that if the author didn't want people to use it for free forever, they'd have a different license method.

I'm sorry, that's not how this works. The author clearly states:

> Sublime Text may be downloaded and evaluated for free, however a license must be purchased for continued use.

As I said on Twitter...

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It surprises me how many people seem to advocate using Sublime for free. If you think the software is great, why not pay what they ask?</p>&mdash; Brian Rinaldi (@remotesynth) <a href="https://twitter.com/remotesynth/status/644542401911083008">September 17, 2015</a></blockquote>
